config IBM_ASM
	tristate "Device driver for IBM RSA service processor"
	depends on X86 && PCI && EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
	  This option enables device driver support for in-band access to the
	  IBM RSA (Condor) service processor in eServer xSeries systems.
	  The ibmasm device driver allows user space application to access
	  ASM (Advanced Systems Management) functions on the service
	  processor. The driver is meant to be used in conjunction with
	  a user space API.
	  The ibmasm driver also enables the OS to use the UART on the
	  service processor board as a regular serial port. To make use of
	  this feature serial driver support (CONFIG_SERIAL_8250) must be
	  enabled.
	  
	  WARNING: This software may not be supported or function
	  correctly on your IBM server. Please consult the IBM ServerProven
	  website <http://www.pc.ibm.com/ww/eserver/xseries/serverproven> for
	  information on the specific driver level and support statement
	  for your IBM server.


	  If unsure, say N.

config EEPROM_93CX6
	tristate "EEPROM 93CX6 support"
	---help---
	  This is a driver for the EEPROM chipsets 93c46 and 93c66.
	  The driver supports both read as well as write commands.

	  If unsure, say N.

config HP_ILO
        tristate "Channel interface driver for HP iLO/iLO2 processor"
        depends on PCI
        default n
        help
          The channel interface driver allows applications to communicate
          with iLO/iLO2 management processors present on HP ProLiant
          servers.  Upon loading, the driver creates /dev/hpilo/dXccbN files,
          which can be used to gather data from the management processor,
          via read and write system calls.

          To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
          module will be called hpilo.

config ENCLOSURE_SERVICES
	tristate "Enclosure Services"
	default n
	help
	  Provides support for intelligent enclosures (bays which
	  contain storage devices).  You also need either a host
	  driver (SCSI/ATA) which supports enclosures
	  or a SCSI enclosure device (SES) to use these services.
