config NET_DMA
	bool "Network: TCP receive copy offload"
	depends on DMA_ENGINE_V3 && NET
	default y
	---help---
	 This enables the use of DMA engines in the network stack to
	 offload receive copy-to-user operations, freeing CPU cycles.
	 Since this is the main user of the DMA engine, it should be enabled;
	 say Y here.
