Description:	Value of 1 indicates the controller can honor the reset_devices
		kernel parameter.  Value of 0 indicates reset_devices cannot be
		honored.  This is to allow, for example, kexec tools to be able
		to warn the user if they designate an unresettable device as
		a dump device, as kdump requires resetting the device in order
		to work reliably.
