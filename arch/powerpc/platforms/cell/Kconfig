	  This option causes SPE local stores to be mapped in process
	  address spaces using 64K pages while the rest of the kernel
	  uses 4K pages. This can improve performances of applications
	  using multiple SPEs by lowering the TLB pressure on them.

          This adds the cpufreq driver for Cell BE processors.

          Select this, if you want to use the PMI interface
          to switch frequencies. Using PMI, the
          processor will not only be able to run at lower speed,
